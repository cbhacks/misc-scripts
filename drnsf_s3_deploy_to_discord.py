#
# This script is intended to run on AWS Lambda. No privileges are required
# beyond the basic Lambda privileges. S3 ObjectCreated events should trigger
# the script, which then reports the object's existence to discord under a URL
# in the following form:
#
# https://{bucket-name}/{object-key}
#
# For example:
#
#   Bucket name:   example.com
#   Object key:    foo/bar.zip
#   Resulting URL: https://example.com/foo/bar.zip
#
# Naturally, you should be serving the S3 objects from a web server on the
# domain matching the bucket's name, otherwise the reported links will not be
# functional.
#
# This script is for the python 3.6 runtime on Lambda. Your upload package
# should include the 'requests' library and its dependencies.
#
# You must provide the following environment variables for configuration:
#
#   DISCORD_WEBHOOK: The webhook URL which the script should post to. This
#   should be a discordapp webhook, or one compatible with that API.
#
#   ADMIN_EMAIL: This should be a contact email address for someone responsible
#   for the administration of the script's execution. It is used for the 'From'
#   HTTP header in the Discord webhook request.
#
# You can test this script under Lambda using the following test event. Modify
# the object key and bucket name as you desire.
#
# {
#   "Records": [
#     {
#       "s3": {
#         "object": {
#           "key": "test-only-please-ignore"
#         },
#         "bucket": {
#           "name": "example.com"
#         }
#       }
#     }
#   ]
# }
#
# If your URL or discord message needs to be formatted differently, you should
# modify the script for this purpose.
